<p>Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer and Systems Administrator with a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and solution design. I graduated from the <a href=https://ece.uowm.gr/?lan=en target=_blank>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href=https://www.uowm.gr/en/ target=_blank>University of Western Macedonia</a> with an Integrated Master's Degree (MEng) in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering. The challenge of unraveling complex problems and creating effective solutions has always fascinated me. As a committed professional, I continuously seek opportunities to broaden my horizons and keep up to date with the latest tools and information in my field. My motivation and ability to perform efficiently under pressure are two of my strongest assets. I'm always striving to learn and evolve, constantly seeking out my next challenge.</p>
