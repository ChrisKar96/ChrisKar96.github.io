<p>I am an aspiring DevOps Engineer and Systems Administrator, studying in the <a href=https://ece.uowm.gr/?lan=en target=_blank>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Western Macedonia</a>. From a young age I discovered my passion for problem solving and designing solutions. I am a hard worker, very eager to learn new things and expand my capabilities every day, always using the most updated tools and information provided. I am also very driven, and I can perform well under pressure.</p>
